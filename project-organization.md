A Template for Project Organization in the Empirical Social Sciences
--------------

__Shiro Kuriwaki__ (kuriwaki@g.harvard.edu)


This brief memo outlines one way to organize an empirical project in the Social Sciences, an area that is increasingly data-driven, program-driven, and collaborative. I rely most on the excellent writeup by economists Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, "Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitionerâ€™s Guide", as well as other resources that have established best practices. My intent is to summarize the key points and update with new resources, rather than re-invent the wheel.
